# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview

Create an admin management page for TSB Bouncy Castle Hire, linked to the primary Google Calendar (`tsbouncycastlehire@gmail.com`). Authentication will utilize Google Accounts, allowing access for the primary account and an additional admin (`matt.mpdee@gmail.com`). The page will enable streamlined management of bookings, availability, and maintenance status of all bouncy castles.

## Objectives

* Centralize booking management.
* Simplify visibility of availability for admins and customers.
* Streamline integration with Google Calendar.
* Enable secure multi-user admin access via Google authentication.

## Features

  * Primary admin (`tsbouncycastlehire@gmail.com`)
  * Secondary admin (`matt.mpdee@gmail.com`)

### Core Functionality

  * Fresh integration setup, syncing bookings directly with the admin calendar.
  * Automatic calendar updates when bookings are created, edited, or canceled.

* **Bouncy Castle Availability Dashboard:**

  * Clear visual dashboard showing real-time availability.
  * Status indicators:

    * **Available**: Highlighted clearly.
    * **Booked Out**: Dates greyed out with booking details.

### Customer-Facing Visibility

### Historical Data and Reporting

* Store and provide historical booking data accessible via the admin dashboard.

## Technical Requirements

* Integration with Google Calendar API.
* Secure Google OAuth authentication.
* Responsive UI ensuring ease of use on desktop and mobile.
* Built using modern web technologies (e.g., React, TailwindCSS).

## Success Metrics
