# Product Requirements Document: Booking System Template

## Introduction/Overview

This project involves converting an existing, fully-functional booking system (currently used for T&S Bouncy Castle Hire) into a reusable, configurable template for web designers and development agencies. The template will provide a complete booking system solution that can be quickly deployed and customized for various industries including event services, equipment rentals, appointment booking, and other service-based businesses.

The goal is to create a standardized, proven booking workflow that reduces development time, eliminates common booking system pitfalls, and provides a professional foundation that can be licensed to other agencies or used for future client projects.

## Goals

1. **Reduce Development Time**: Provide a ready-to-deploy booking system that eliminates 80-90% of booking system development work
2. **Standardize Booking Workflows**: Establish proven user flows for booking, payment, and administration
3. **Enable Multi-Industry Usage**: Create configurable components that work for events, services, rentals, appointments, and more
4. **Simplify Customization**: Implement configuration-driven customization requiring minimal code changes
5. **Provide Professional Documentation**: Create comprehensive setup guides for different skill levels
6. **Ensure Data Security**: Remove all client-specific data and implement secure placeholder systems

## User Stories

### Primary Users (Web Designers/Developers):
- **As a web designer**, I want to quickly deploy a booking system for my clients so that I can focus on design and branding rather than complex booking logic
- **As a developer**, I want configurable booking components so that I can customize the system for different industries without rewriting core functionality
- **As an agency owner**, I want to license a proven booking template so that my team can deliver consistent, professional booking solutions

### Secondary Users (End Clients):
- **As a service business owner**, I want a professional booking system that handles my specific industry needs without requiring custom development
- **As a business administrator**, I want an intuitive admin panel to manage bookings, calendar, and customer data

### End Users (Customers):
- **As a customer**, I want to easily browse available services and make bookings through a smooth, professional interface
- **As a repeat customer**, I want my booking history and preferences to be remembered for faster future bookings

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Data Sanitization & Placeholder System
1.1. Remove all references to "T&S Bouncy Castle Hire" and replace with configurable business name placeholders

2.3. Configure terminology system (Fleet/Services/Inventory/Products) based on business type
2.4. Enable customizable booking workflows and form fields
2.5. Provide theme/styling configuration options

### 3. Generic Content Management
3.1. Convert "Fleet" pages to configurable "Services/Products/Inventory" pages
3.2. Implement generic service/product categories and attributes
3.3. Create sample content for multiple business types (event planning, equipment rental, service booking)
3.4. Provide placeholder images and content that can be easily replaced

### 4. Template Structure & Components

5.3. Include configuration guide with industry-specific examples
5.4. Create troubleshooting guide for common setup issues
5.5. Document all customization options and extension points

### 6. Multi-Industry Adaptability
6.1. Provide configuration presets for common industries:
   - Event Services (bouncy castles, party equipment)

   - Appointment Booking (consultations, services)
   - Venue Booking (rooms, facilities)
6.2. Include industry-specific terminology and workflow variations
6.3. Provide sample data sets for different business types

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Custom Industry Features**: Will not include highly specialized features for specific industries
2. **Multi-tenant System**: Template is designed for single-business deployment, not SaaS platforms
3. **Advanced CRM Integration**: Basic booking management only, not full CRM replacement
4. **Payment Gateway Integration**: Will maintain existing payment structure but not add new payment methods
5. **Mobile App Development**: Web-based template only, no native mobile applications
6. **Multi-language Support**: Template will be English-only initially
7. **Advanced Analytics**: Basic reporting only, not comprehensive business intelligence

## Design Considerations

1. **Maintain Current UI/UX**: Preserve the existing design system and user experience
2. **Configurable Branding**: Enable easy logo, color, and typography customization
3. **Responsive Design**: Ensure all templates work across devices and screen sizes
4. **Component Library**: Utilize existing Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS structure
5. **Accessibility**: Maintain current accessibility standards and best practices

## Technical Considerations

1. **Technology Stack**: Preserve existing Next.js, TypeScript, React structure
2. **Database Schema**: Generalize existing database schema while maintaining functionality
3. **Environment Configuration**: Create comprehensive environment variable documentation
4. **Security**: Ensure all authentication and authorization systems remain secure
5. **Performance**: Maintain current performance optimizations and best practices
6. **Dependencies**: Document all required dependencies and version requirements

## Success Metrics

1. **Setup Time Reduction**: New booking system deployment should take < 4 hours vs. weeks of custom development
2. **Configuration Flexibility**: Support at least 5 different industry types with minimal code changes
3. **Documentation Quality**: 90% of users should be able to deploy without additional support
4. **Code Reusability**: 80% of original functionality should be preserved and reusable
5. **Customization Speed**: Basic branding and content customization should take < 2 hours
