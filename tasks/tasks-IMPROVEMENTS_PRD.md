# Tasks: T&S Improvements PRD

## Relevant Files

- `lib/database/bookings.ts` - Database query optimization and indexing changes
- `lib/database/castles.ts` - Castle data queries optimization
- `lib/database/init.ts` - Database schema and index creation
- `src/app/api/*/route.ts` - API routes for caching implementation and rate limiting
- `lib/utils/logger.ts` - New structured logging utility (to be created)
- `lib/utils/performance-monitor.ts` - Performance monitoring utility (to be created)
- `lib/validation/schemas.ts` - Zod validation schemas (to be created)
- `lib/auth/middleware.ts` - Rate limiting middleware implementation
- `components/ui/error-boundary.tsx` - Error boundary component (to be created)
- `lib/config/environment.ts` - Environment variable validation (to be created)
- `next.config.js` - Bundle optimization and code splitting configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration updates
- `vitest.config.ts` - Testing infrastructure setup (to be created)
- `package.json` - Dependencies for testing, validation, and performance monitoring

### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing
- Use `npm run test` to run tests once Vitest is configured
- Database changes require careful testing and potential migration scripts
- Performance monitoring should be implemented incrementally to measure impact

## Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Critical Performance Improvements (Phase 1)
  - [x] 1.1 Audit and optimize database queries - Replace all `SELECT *` with specific column selections
  - [x] 1.2 Create database indexes for frequently queried fields (status + date, customer_email, maintenance_status)
  - [x] 1.3 Remove all console.log statements from production code (100+ instances identified)
  - [ ] 1.4 Implement API response caching with Next.js Cache-Control headers
  - [ ] 1.5 Add React Query for client-side caching of static data (castles, settings)
  - [ ] 1.6 Optimize database connection pooling configuration
  - [ ] 1.7 Test and measure performance impact of optimizations

- [ ] 2.0 Code Quality Improvements (Phase 2)
  - [ ] 2.1 Create structured logging utility class to replace console.log statements

  - [ ] 4.5 Create unit tests for critical business logic (booking creation, validation)
  - [ ] 4.6 Add image optimization configuration for WebP/AVIF formats
  - [ ] 4.7 Configure webpack bundle analyzer for ongoing monitoring
  - [ ] 4.8 Set up pre-commit hooks for code quality checks
